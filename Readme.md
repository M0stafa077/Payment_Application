# Payment Application Project

Hi! This is my Payment Application Project in C programming language, the project implements three main modules : (Card, Terminal, and Server) through the App module. The project is to facilitate the process of transactions for the users.

## Layers

The project consists of three main layers as follow:

 - **Card Layer :** Handles the data of the user's card.
 - **Terminal Layer :** Checks the expiration date of the card depending on today's date.
 - **Server Layer :** Handles all the server-side functions like checking the validation of 		     						the account depending on the database information and also updates the balance of the account after every successful transaction operation.
